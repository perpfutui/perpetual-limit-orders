# Advanced Order Functionality on the Perpetual Protocol	

The aim of these contracts is to provide advanced order functionality on the [Perpetual Protocol](https://docs.perp.fi). The contracts leverage the decentralised perpetual futures trading protocol built by the Perp team and adds additional functionality, such as the ability to create limit orders and other advanced order types. 

The aim of is to create a decentralised and trustless system that is fully non-custodial. While other AMM based derivative DEXs rely on a trusted set up to execute limit orders, our smart contracts ensure the timely execution of orders through a permissionless network of keeper-bots. 

For more details on the implementation please read the [docs](https://docs.apex.win/apex-docs/).
